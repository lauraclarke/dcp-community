## Motivation

Currently, the only means of listing bundles stored in the DSS is the internal Elasticsearch (ES) metadata index, which
must be kept current with object storage. The DSS should provide bundle enumeration independently of the ES metadata index,
emphasizing consistency and scalability.

### User Stories

* As a downstream service developer, I would like to enumerate the bundle contents of the DSS so I can create my own
  index.

* As a downstream service developer, I would like to check if my index contains all the bundles in the DSS.

## Detailed Design

A bundle enumeration endpoint will be introduced, taking `replica` and `prefix` parameters. These parameters will
be used to return a paginated listing of bundles directly from object storage.
